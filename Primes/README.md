# Primes
Prime finding programs.

## Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes
### Usage
`eratosthenes-c or eratosthenes-rs` to search for all primes < 9,999,999,999 (~1/8 gb memory)

`eratosthenes-c or eratosthenes-rs [number]` to search for all primes < number

### Notes
C version is faster by a smidge, but this is my first Rust program so if there are any optimisations that can be made (to either) please let me know!
